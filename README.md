## Introduction / Summary
This lab focuses on the use of ultrasonic sensors for object detection and distance measurement, like systems used in modern vehicles to prevent collisions. The integration of libraries will control the robot's wheels, and a program will be developed to avoid obstacles. Additionally, the lab covers the differences between analog and digital sensors, highlighting their respective signal types and applications. Analog sensors provide a continuous range of values and require analog-to-digital conversion, while digital sensors offer discrete values, commonly represented as 0V or 5V. The ultrasonic sensor, which uses echolocation to measure distance, will be a key component in the collision avoidance system.

## Methods / Tests


---

## Results
To find test the program, make the motors turn right, turn left, and go backward at any speed.
The results of this lab should be demonstrated to the instructor. In addition, the code used for Part 1 and Part 2 should be examined for approval by the instructor. The motors should stop when the distance of the object is less than 10 cm.

## Discussion/Questions
**What is the minimum speed number for the motors to move forward?**

-The slowest the ‘Slow_speed’ can go is 80 rpm
